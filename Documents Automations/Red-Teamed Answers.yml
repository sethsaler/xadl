        Analyze the given earnings call transcripts, generate analyst profiles, create and answer questions, and perform red-teaming to improve answers. Only output the final analyst profiles and improved question-answer pairs.

        {% if earningsCallDocuments %}
        Here are the earnings call transcripts for analysis:
        {% for doc in earningsCallDocuments %}
        ```Text
        {{ doc.xdoc.text }}
        ```
        {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}

        {% if questionDocument %}
        Question source:
        {% for doc in questionDocument %}
        {{ doc.xdoc.text }}
        {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}

        {% endif %}

        Complete the following tasks based on the provided information. Do not generate any output until explicitly instructed to do so:

        1. Analyst Identification and Profiling (Keep in memory, do not output):
        a) Search through the question-and-answer portion of the earnings call transcripts.
        b) Identify all analysts who ask questions and note the frequency of questions asked by each.
        c) For each identified analyst, create a detailed profile including:
            - Name and associated financial institution
            - Questioning style (e.g., direct, technical, big-picture oriented)
            - Particular areas of interest or focus
            - Any notable patterns or trends in their questioning
        d) Organize the analyst profiles in descending order of question frequency.

        2. Question Generation and Multi-Sentiment Answering (Keep in memory, do not output):
        a) For each analyst profile, devise 5-10 non-obvious, complex questions they might ask in future earnings calls.
        b) Ensure questions are novel and based on the analyst's profile, interests, and current market trends.
        c) For each generated question:
            - Create a concise, single-paragraph answer with positive sentiment
            - Create a concise, single-paragraph answer with neutral sentiment
            - Create a concise, single-paragraph answer with negative sentiment
        d) Ensure all answers directly address the question and maintain factual accuracy across sentiments.

        3. Red-Teaming and Answer Improvement (Keep in memory, do not output):
        a) For each set of answers (positive, neutral, negative):
            - Identify potential biases, logical fallacies, or factual inaccuracies
            - Point out any inconsistencies between the different sentiment versions
            - Highlight areas where the answer could be more comprehensive or nuanced
        b) Based on the red-teaming feedback, generate an improved, balanced answer that:
            - Addresses the identified issues
            - Incorporates the strengths from each sentiment version
            - Provides a more comprehensive and accurate response to the question

        4. Output Generation:
        Now, generate the following outputs based on the analysis performed in the previous steps:

        a) Analyst Profiles:
            Present each analyst profile as a series of paragraphs with a brief introduction. Include all relevant details from step 1.

        b) Improved Question and Answer Pairs:
            For each analyst, present their generated questions along with the improved answers:
            
            Analyst: [Analyst Name]
            Question: [Generated question]
            Improved Answer: [Red-team-improved answer from step 3b]
            [Repeat for all questions for this analyst]

            [Repeat for all analysts]

        Ensure your response is structured, detailed, and only includes the analyst profiles and improved question-answer pairs as specified in step 4.
