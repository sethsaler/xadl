Use [Instructions.md] and [File.yml] together to create the initial structural
setup of a YAML file. I need you to create the YAML such that there is a document
and workspace input. The actions will need to get and use tags from a category
called "Performance Triggers." Then, I need you to create the appropriate actions
for initializing the knowledge set, set up appropriate dimensions/nodes, and build
out the functions that would iterate/loop over each of the tags within Performance
Triggers to evaluate the content of the snippets with those tags for items in a
contract that indicate one or both parties has an obligation to perform a task based
on some criteria. I need you to also provide some well-reasoned structural output in
the LLM tool section.
