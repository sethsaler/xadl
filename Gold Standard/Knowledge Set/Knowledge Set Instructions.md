# Knowledge Set Instructions

Use **[Project Plan.md]** and **[File.yml]** together to create the initial structural setup of a YAML file. 

## Requirements

1. Create the YAML such that there is a document and workspace input.
2. The actions will need to get and use tags from a category called **[Tag Category or Categories]**.
3. Create the appropriate actions for:
   - Initializing the knowledge set
   - Setting up appropriate dimensions/nodes
   - Building out the functions that would iterate/loop over each of the tags within **[Tag Category or Categories]** to evaluate the content of the snippets with those tags for items **[instructions for the task to be accomplished]**.

## Additional Notes

- Remember that even singular tags will need to be evaluated as part of a for loop with a repeat function and a tag variable.
- Provide some well-reasoned structural output in the LLM tool section.
