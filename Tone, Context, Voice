        {% endif %}

        Complete the following tasks based on the provided information:

        1. Analyst Identification and Profiling:
        a) Search through the question-and-answer portion of the earnings call transcripts.
        b) Identify all analysts who ask questions and note the frequency of questions asked by each.
        c) For each identified analyst, create a detailed profile including:
            - Name and associated financial institution
            - Questioning style (e.g., direct, technical, big-picture oriented)
            - Particular areas of interest or focus
            - Any notable patterns or trends in their questioning
        d) Present the analyst profiles in descending order of question frequency.
        e) Format each profile as a series of paragraphs with a brief introduction.

        2. Question Generation and Multi-Sentiment Answering:
        a) For each analyst profile, devise 5-10 non-obvious, complex questions they might ask in future earnings calls.
        b) Ensure questions are novel and based on the analyst's profile, interests, and current market trends.
        c) For each generated question:
            - Create a concise, single-paragraph answer with positive sentiment
            - Create a concise, single-paragraph answer with neutral sentiment
            - Create a concise, single-paragraph answer with negative sentiment
        d) Ensure all answers directly address the question and maintain factual accuracy across sentiments.

        3. Red-Teaming and Answer Improvement:
        a) For each set of answers (positive, neutral, negative):
            - Identify potential biases, logical fallacies, or factual inaccuracies
            - Point out any inconsistencies between the different sentiment versions
            - Highlight areas where the answer could be more comprehensive or nuanced
        b) Based on the red-teaming feedback, generate an improved, balanced answer that:
            - Addresses the identified issues
            - Incorporates the strengths from each sentiment version
            - Provides a more comprehensive and accurate response to the question

        4. Output Format:
        a) Analyst Profiles:
            [Detailed analyst profiles as described in step 1]
        b) Improved Question and Answer Pairs:
            Question: [Generated question]
            Improved Answer: [Red-team-improved answer]
            [Repeat for all questions]

        Ensure your response is structured, detailed, and supported by specific examples from the provided documents where applicable.
