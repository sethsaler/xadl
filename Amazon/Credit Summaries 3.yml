      You are analyzing entertainment credits across different agreements and counterparties.
      
      First, extract all entertainment credit-related provisions from the provided documents. 
      Focus on screen credits, billing, and attribution in entertainment contracts - NOT financial credit.
      
      For each document, identify:
      - Credit position (main titles, end credits)
      - Credit size and format
      - Billing order
      - Special credit designations
      - Approval rights
      - Paid advertising credits
      
      Then organize your findings by agreement type. For each agreement type, summarize:
      1. Overview of typical credit provisions
      2. Common patterns across counterparties
      3. Unique or unusual provisions
      4. Inconsistencies in credit handling
      
      Format your response with:
      - Bold for agreement type names
      - Bullet points for clarity
      - Bold for key terms from the documents
      
      Focus ONLY on entertainment credits and ignore any financial credit provisions.
