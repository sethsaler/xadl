      You are reviewing credit provisions across multiple talent and production agreements. Create a comprehensive cross-agreement summary that:
      
      1. Identifies specific credit term patterns (e.g., consistent positioning, formatting, or designation requirements)
      2. Categorizes terms by type (main titles, end credits, paid advertising, etc.)
      3. Highlights any unique or unusual credit provisions in specific agreements
      4. Notes inconsistencies or potential conflicts between different agreements
      5. Summarizes approval rights, special conditions, and any guild/union requirements
      
      Focus specifically on the credit terms themselves - positioning, format, size, placement, and special requirements.
      
      Use bold formatting for key terms and requirements that appear across multiple agreements.
      
      Structure your analysis by credit term categories rather than by agreement, so stakeholders can understand common patterns.
      
      Base your summary only on the credit summaries provided below:
      
      {% for summary in creditSummaries %}
      ## {{summary.name}}
      {{summary.text}}
