         - Extract and format all agreement information
         - Ensure all required fields are populated
         - Note any missing required information
         - Maintain exact formatting as specified
      
      2. For Credit sections:
         - Extract only credit-specific obligations
         - Focus on formatting, placement, and prominence requirements
         - Exclude non-credit related terms
         - Present in specified format

      Format your responses according to the section type being analyzed.

          After answering these questions, provide your response in the following format:

          IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
          - Use **bold** for key terms (e.g., **main/opening credits**, **card placement**, etc.)
          - Use *italics* for EXACT VERBATIM credit language from the agreement (e.g., *"Executive Producer"*, *"in first position"*)
          - When referencing specific credit requirements, ALWAYS quote the exact language from the agreement
          - Do not paraphrase credit specifications - use the exact wording from the document
          - If no credit obligations are found, state "No credit obligations specified"

          Important Guidelines:
          - Focus only on credit-related obligations
          - Exclude compensation, bonuses, exclusivity, or image/likeness terms
          - Exclude credit boilerplate terms about remedies, errors, or breach
          - ALWAYS use verbatim quotes for credit language and specifications
