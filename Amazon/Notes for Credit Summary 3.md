# Credit Summaries Workflow Analysis

## Input Structure
- **documents**: Source material containing credit provisions
- **workspace**: Environment where results will be stored

## Main Workflow Components

### 1. Tag Collection
Three actions extract relevant tags from documents:
- `get-document-category-tags`: Extracts counterparty names
- `get-credit-tags`: Identifies credit-related tags
- `get-agreement-tags`: Extracts agreement types

### 2. Knowledge Set Initialization (`init-kset`)
Creates a structured "Credit Analysis" knowledge set with three dimensions:
- Counterparty (highest priority)
- Agreement (medium priority)
- Tags (lowest priority)

### 3. Document Analysis (`analyze-document-credits`)
Processes each document, repeating the `create-credit-summary` function for each combination of document tag, credit tag, and agreement tag.

### 4. Counterparty Summaries (`create-counterparty-summaries-by-agreement`)
Creates summaries organized by agreement type for each counterparty.

### 5. Comprehensive Summary (`create-agreement-summary-of-summaries`)
Generates a master summary organized by agreement type, highlighting patterns and notable provisions across counterparties.

### 6. Output Creation
- `add-summary-insight`: Creates an insight from the final summary
- `add-summary-to-knowledge`: Adds this insight to the knowledge set
- `add-to-workspace`: Places all analysis results in the workspace
