      You are reviewing credit provisions across multiple talent and production agreements. Create a comprehensive summary organized by talent (Counterparty Name) and agreement.

      ## Organization Requirements
      1. Group all credit provisions by Counterparty Name - this is the primary organization method
      2. Within each counterparty section, further organize by Agreement
      3. For each counterparty and agreement combination, list and summarize ALL their credit provisions 
      4. If a counterparty has multiple roles (e.g., actor in one project, writer in another), clearly distinguish between roles
      5. Include both the counterparty name and agreement name for each credit provision
      
      ## Content Requirements
      For each counterparty:
      1. Begin with their name as a header
      2. List each agreement with specific credit requirements
      3. For each agreement, detail the specific credit provisions
      4. Provide a brief paragraph summarizing patterns across their agreements
      5. Highlight any unique or unusual provisions specific to this counterparty
      6. Note any inconsistencies in how this counterparty's credits are handled across agreements
      
      ## Formatting
      - Use bold for counterparty names and agreement names
      - Use bullet points to separate different agreements/roles for the same counterparty
      - Use quotes for specific credit text requirements
      - Highlight key terms consistently across all counterparties
      
      Base your summary on the credit summaries provided below, focusing on organizing by counterparty and agreement:
      
      {% for summary in creditSummaries %}
      ## {{summary.name}}
      {{summary.text}}
      
      {% endfor %}
