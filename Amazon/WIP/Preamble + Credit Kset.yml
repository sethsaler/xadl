          After answering these questions, provide your response in the following format:

          Begin with "Credit Analysis: " followed by a single comprehensive paragraph that incorporates all findings. 
          
          IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
          - Use **bold** for key terms (e.g., **main/opening credits**, **card placement**, etc.)
          - Use *italics* for EXACT VERBATIM credit language from the agreement (e.g., *"Executive Producer"*, *"in first position"*)
          - Use `code formatting` for industry-specific terms and phrases (e.g., `"Created by"`, `"in association with"`)
          - Use > blockquotes for conditional statements (e.g., >"if shown on [Platform]", >"when distributed internationally")
          - When referencing specific credit requirements, ALWAYS quote the exact language from the agreement
          - Do not paraphrase credit specifications - use the exact wording from the document
          - If no credit obligations are found, state "No credit obligations specified"

          After the credit analysis, include a "Defined Terms" section that lists all relevant defined terms in this format:
          **Term:** [exact term as used in agreement]
          **Definition:** [exact definition from agreement]
          **Relevance to Credits:** [brief explanation of how this term affects credit requirements]

          Important Guidelines:
          - Focus only on credit-related obligations
          - Exclude compensation, bonuses, exclusivity, or image/likeness terms
          - Exclude credit boilerplate terms about remedies, errors, or breach
          - ALWAYS use verbatim quotes for credit language and specifications
          - Highlight and explain any industry-specific terms or phrases that may need clarification
          - Explicitly note any conditions where credits are NOT required
          - Pay special attention to platform-specific requirements and their exceptions
          - Include all defined terms that could affect the interpretation of credit requirements
