**Original State (Knowledge Set Approach):**

*   **Inputs**: Took documents and a workspace as input.
*   **Tag Finding**: Used `find-tags` to identify "Agreement Information" tags (Credit, Preamble) and "Document Tags".
*   **Iteration**: Used a `repeat` action (`analyze-each-documentCategory-tag`) to call a function (`analyze-for-tag`) for each combination of a "Document Tag" and an "Agreement Tag".
*   **Function Logic (`analyze-for-tag`):**
    *   Fetched specific snippets using `document-text` based on the current pair of tags.
    *   Generated conditional `instructionPrompt` text based on the `agreementTag`.
    *   Ran an `llm` (`run-prompt`) using the base prompt, the specific instructions, and the fetched snippets.
    *   Created an `insight` using the `llm` result and associated it with the tags and snippets.
    *   Added the `insight` and snippets to a `knowledge-set` (`init-kset`) using `set-nodes` operations within the function (`add-insight`).
*   **Final Output**: Added the fully populated `knowledge-set` (`init-kset`) to the input workspace using `add-items`. The workspace item was the final result.

**Refactored State (Inline Generation Approach):**

*   **Inputs**: Takes only documents as input. The workspace input was removed.
*   **Tag Finding**: Still uses `find-tags` to get the primary "Agreement Information" tags (Credit, Preamble). The unused `get-documentCategory-tags` action was removed to avoid ambiguity about the final output.
*   **Consolidated Snippet Extraction**: Removed the `repeat` loop and the `analyze-for-tag` function. Instead, a single `document-text` action (`get-relevant-snippets`) now fetches all text snippets associated with any of the primary tags (Credit, Preamble) across all documents at once.
*   **Single LLM Call**:
    *   Removed the intermediate `llm` call (`run-prompt`) that was inside the function.
    *   Added a final `generate-summary` action using the `llm` tool.
    *   This single LLM prompt now includes:
        *   The original `basePrompt` content.
        *   All the specific formatting instructions previously handled conditionally (for both "Preamble" and "Credit"), clearly laid out.
        *   A loop (`{% for s in snippets %}`) to include all the text from `get-relevant-snippets`.
        *   `skipIfEmpty: snippets` was added to this action as requested.
*   **Final Output**: The direct output of the `generate-summary` LLM call is now the final result of the automation. There's no knowledge set or workspace involved.

**Why the Changes?**

*   The goal was to mirror the pattern in `Topic Summarizer.yml`, which directly generates a document rather than populating a data structure like a knowledge set.
*   **Simplicity**: The inline approach is often simpler, involving fewer distinct actions and removing the need for managing intermediate data structures (knowledge sets, insights).
*   **Direct Output**: It directly produces the desired text document/summary as the final output of the LLM step.
*   **Efficiency**: It potentially reduces overhead by having fewer tool calls (no looping, no separate insight creation, no knowledge set/workspace operations). The trade-off is a potentially larger, more complex single prompt for the final LLM call.
*   In essence, we shifted from an iterative process that stored structured findings in a knowledge set to
