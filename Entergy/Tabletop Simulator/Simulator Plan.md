Project Objectives:

Create an engaging tabletop simulation system that tests knowledge of utility company safety protocols
Develop a flexible scenario framework that can accommodate various emergency and routine situations
Enable both individual and team-based learning experiences
Provide measurable assessment capabilities for safety protocol knowledge
Allow for easy updates as policies and procedures change

Phase 1: Planning and Research (4-6 weeks)

Conduct interviews with safety managers and field personnel to identify key scenarios
Review existing safety protocols and training materials
Analyze incident reports from the past 3-5 years to identify common challenges
Research similar training simulations for best practices
Define success metrics and assessment criteria

Phase 2: Game Design Development (8-10 weeks)

Create core game mechanics including:

Turn structure and player roles
Decision-making framework
Scoring and assessment system
Time pressure mechanics
Team communication rules


Design scenario template structure
Develop question format guidelines
Create feedback mechanisms
Design physical components (cards, boards, tokens)

Phase 3: Content Creation Framework (6-8 weeks)

Establish scenario writing guidelines
Create templates for:

Emergency scenarios
Routine procedure scenarios
Multiple choice questions
Team discussion prompts
Assessment rubrics


Develop difficulty scaling system
Create facilitator guide
Design progress tracking system

Phase 4: Testing and Iteration (6-8 weeks)

Internal playtesting with safety team
Pilot program with select field crews
Gather feedback on:

Game flow and engagement
Scenario realism
Assessment effectiveness
Facilitator experience
Physical components


Revise based on feedback
Secondary testing round

Phase 5: Production and Implementation (8-10 weeks)

Finalize all game components
Create training program for facilitators
Develop implementation schedule
Create maintenance and update procedures
Establish metrics collection system
Produce initial run of physical components

Phase 6: Rollout and Monitoring (12 weeks)

Train initial group of facilitators
Begin phased rollout to different departments
Collect initial performance data
Gather facilitator feedback
Make necessary adjustments
Establish regular review and update schedule

Key Considerations:
Technical Requirements:

Physical components must be durable and replaceable
Clear visual design for easy reading in various conditions
Portable and quick to set up
Easy to update as procedures change

Administrative Requirements:

System for tracking participation and performance
Method for updating content as policies change
Process for facilitator certification
Procedure for gathering and incorporating feedback

Risk Mitigation:

Regular review of scenario accuracy
Clear distinction between simulation and real-world procedures
Multiple approval layers for new content
Regular validation against current safety protocols

Success Metrics:

Participant engagement levels
Knowledge retention rates
Team communication improvement
Reduction in safety incidents
Facilitator satisfaction
Ease of content updates

Budget Considerations:

Initial development costs
Production of physical components
Facilitator training
Ongoing maintenance and updates
Replacement parts
Assessment and tracking tools
