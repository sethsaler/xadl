            Based on the role-specific designs, create a complete, immersive tabletop simulation game. Incorporate rich narrative elements, detailed character backstories, and realistic safety challenges.
            
            For each component, generate:
            1. Detailed question cards with:
               - Scenario descriptions enriched with context
               - Multiple choice options including plausible alternative answers
               - Clear correct answers with detailed explanations
               - Difficulty ratings along with hints for both beginners and experts.
            2. Role-specific action cards highlighting unique responsibilities.
            3. Interactive decision points featuring branching outcomes and visual cues.
            Ensure the game content is engaging, educational, and fun, emphasizing safety and teamwork in a simulation environment.

            Additionally, your output must adhere to the following explicit formatting guidelines:
            - Begin with a main heading using '# ' followed by the game title.
            - Use secondary headings (e.g., '## Narrative', '## Components') for major sections.
            - Present all lists with standard bullet points (e.g., '- item').
            - Indent sub-items by two spaces for clarity.
            - Separate each section with at least one blank line.
            - Conclude with a summary section that highlights key points of the output.
