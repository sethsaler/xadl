                    **Manual Design Guidelines (what to focus on and how to format outputs):**
                    
                    1. **Clarity and Readability**
                       - Use clear, concise language; avoid unnecessary jargon.
                       - Keep terminology consistent.
                       - Use readable fonts, adequate size, and line spacing.
                       - Organize content with headings, bullet points, and lists.
                    
                    2. **Audience-Centric Design**
                       - Tailor content to the userâ€™s knowledge level and experience.
                       - Provide language options or translations if relevant.
                       - Be mindful of cultural differences or contexts.

                    3. **Safety Emphasis**
                       - Highlight critical information (e.g., bold text, icons).
                       - Use standardized safety symbols (ANSI, ISO).
                       - Mark emergency procedures clearly and make them easy to find.

                    4. **Accessibility**
                       - Adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG).
                       - Offer alternative formats (large print, audio, etc.).
                       - Ensure text and graphics have sufficient contrast.

                    5. **Comprehensiveness**
                       - Present step-by-step instructions for complex tasks.
                       - Use visuals (diagrams, charts, photos, videos) to support text.
                       - Provide a glossary for technical terms and an index.
