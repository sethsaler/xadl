# Overviews.yml Explanation

This YAML file sets up an automated system to analyze telecom tariff documents across six key categories:

1. Performance Obligations
2. Payment Obligations 
3. Termination
4. Service Level Agreements (SLA)
5. Transferability
6. Liabilities

## What Does It Do?

1. **Document Tagging**: The system first tags different sections of documents based on these categories.

2. **Base Configuration**: Sets up a role as a telecommunications regulatory expert with specific analysis objectives.

3. **Analysis Process**: For each category, the system:
   - Finds relevant text sections using tags
   - Analyzes the content using specific prompts
   - Creates structured summaries with key points
   - Stores insights in a knowledge base

4. **Output Format**: For each category, it generates analysis in specific formats, such as:
   - Service overviews
   - Key performance indicators
   - Strategic considerations
   - Financial safeguards
   - Risk assessments

5. **Knowledge Management**: All insights are stored in a structured knowledge set that can be:
   - Queried later
   - Used for comparisons
   - Added to a workspace for further analysis

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each category has its own analysis function
- **Structured Output**: Consistent formatting across all analyses
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyzes both individual sections and entire documents
- **Strategic Focus**: Includes business implications and regulatory considerations

This system essentially acts as an automated tariff analyst, breaking down complex telecom documents into structured, actionable insights.
