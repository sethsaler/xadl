# Granular Comparison.yml Explanation

This YAML file creates a detailed comparison system for analyzing differences between multiple tariff documents at a granular level.

## Main Purpose

The system compares how different tariff documents handle the same categories (like Performance, Payment, etc.) by analyzing specific details and creating detailed comparisons.

## How It Works

1. **Document Identification**:
   - Identifies specific tariff documents (Florida No. 7, Florida No. 8, Ohio No. 4, Iowa)
   - Tags content by category and document

2. **Analysis Process**:
   - Takes each document-category pair
   - Extracts relevant sections
   - Creates detailed summaries
   - Generates comparisons between documents

3. **Comparison Matrix**:
   For each pair of documents, it analyzes differences in:
   - Obligations and Requirements
   - Terms and Conditions
   - Risk and Responsibility
   - Financial Impact
   - Operations

## Key Outputs

The system produces two types of insights:
1. **Individual Document Analysis**: Detailed summary of how each document handles each category
2. **Comparison Analysis**: Detailed comparison between documents for each category

## Comparison Categories

Each comparison looks at:
- Core requirements
- Technical specifications
- Measurement/reporting methods
- Compliance approaches
- Definitional differences
- Process variations
- Risk allocation
- Financial terms
- Operational approaches

This system is designed for detailed, side-by-side comparisons of tariff documents, highlighting specific differences in how each document handles various aspects of telecom services.
