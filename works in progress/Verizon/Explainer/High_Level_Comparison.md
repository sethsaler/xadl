# High-Level Comparison.yml Explanation

This YAML file sets up a system for comparing documents at a higher, more strategic level, focusing on broader patterns and significant differences rather than minute details.

## Purpose

The system provides a bird's-eye view of how different documents approach various categories, making it easier to spot major differences and patterns across documents.

## How It Works

1. **Document Organization**:
   - Groups documents by major categories
   - Creates high-level summaries
   - Identifies key themes and approaches

2. **Analysis Approach**:
   - Looks at broad patterns
   - Identifies significant differences
   - Focuses on strategic implications
   - Notes standardization opportunities

3. **Comparison Structure**:
   Creates comparisons focusing on:
   - Main requirements
   - Unique approaches
   - Critical implementation details
   - Material differences
   - Standardization opportunities

## Key Differences from Granular Comparison

- **Scope**: Broader, more strategic view vs detailed analysis
- **Detail Level**: High-level patterns vs specific differences
- **Focus**: Strategic implications vs technical details
- **Output**: Summary-level insights vs detailed comparisons

## Primary Outputs

1. **Category Summaries**: High-level overview of how each document handles categories
2. **Cross-Document Analysis**: Strategic comparison of approaches across documents
3. **Standardization Opportunities**: Identification of areas where approaches could be standardized

This system is designed for executives and decision-makers who need a strategic overview of document differences without getting into technical details.
