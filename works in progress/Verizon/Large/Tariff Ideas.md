1. Performance Obligations:  This is crucial as it defines what each party must do.

Specificity: Are the obligations clearly defined and measurable? Vague terms like "reasonable efforts" are problematic. They'll want specific service level agreements (SLAs) with metrics (e.g., latency, packet loss, uptime, call completion rates).
Scope: What services are covered? Is it just transport, or does it include things like signaling, billing, or access to specific network elements? Are there any exclusions?
Capacity: Is the capacity sufficient for current and projected needs? How is capacity provisioned and scaled? What happens if demand exceeds capacity?
Interconnection Points: Where exactly does the interconnection occur? Who is responsible for maintaining the connection at each point?
Maintenance and Support: Who is responsible for maintenance and repairs? What are the service level agreements for restoration times? How are outages handled and communicated?
Changes and Upgrades: How are changes to the network or services handled? Is there a process for notification and approval? Who bears the cost of upgrades?
2. Payment Obligations:  Clear and unambiguous payment terms are essential.

Pricing: How is pricing determined? Is it usage-based, fixed, or a combination? Are there volume discounts? How are rates adjusted over time (e.g., inflation, changes in technology)?
Billing: How frequently are invoices issued? What format do they take? What level of detail is provided? Is there a process for disputing invoices?
Payment Terms: When are payments due? What are the penalties for late payment?
Taxes: Who is responsible for paying taxes?
Discounts and Credits: Are there any discounts or credits available?
Currency: Which currency are payments made in?
3. Liability:  This section allocates risk between the parties.

Limitations of Liability: Are there caps on liability? What types of damages are excluded (e.g., consequential damages, lost profits)? These are often heavily negotiated.
Indemnification: Who indemnifies whom for what? For example, if one party's negligence causes harm to a third party, who is responsible for covering the costs? Intellectual property infringement is a common concern.
Force Majeure: What events are considered force majeure (e.g., natural disasters, war)? How are obligations affected by force majeure?
Insurance: What types of insurance are required? What are the coverage amounts?
4. Transferability:  Can the agreement be assigned to another party?

Restrictions: Are there any restrictions on transferability? Often, the other party's consent is required.
Change of Control: What happens if there is a change of control of one of the parties (e.g., merger, acquisition)?
5. Term and Termination:

Term Length: How long does the agreement last?
Renewal: How is the agreement renewed? Is it automatic?
Termination: Under what circumstances can the agreement be terminated? What are the notice requirements? Are there penalties for early termination?
Survival Clauses: Which provisions survive termination of the agreement (e.g., confidentiality, payment obligations)?
6. Dispute Resolution:

Governing Law: Which state's law governs the agreement?
Dispute Resolution Process: How are disputes resolved (e.g., negotiation, mediation, arbitration, litigation)?
7. Confidentiality:

Definition of Confidential Information: What information is considered confidential?
Obligations of Confidentiality: What are the parties' obligations with respect to confidential information?
Exceptions: Are there any exceptions to the confidentiality obligations?
8. Other Important Considerations:

Regulatory Compliance: Does the agreement comply with all applicable regulations? This is especially critical in the telecom industry.
Network Security: Are there provisions addressing network security and data protection?
Service Level Agreements (SLAs): As mentioned earlier, these are crucial and should be very detailed.
Interoperability: Does the agreement ensure interoperability with the other party's network?
