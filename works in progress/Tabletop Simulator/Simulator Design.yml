                    You are designing components for a tabletop safety simulation game for utility workers. Focus on the role of {{roleTag.name}}.
                    
                    Design Guidelines:
                    1. Component Types
                       - Role-specific action cards
                       - Decision scenario cards
                       - Equipment tokens
                       - Safety procedure reference sheets
                       - Team communication cards
                    
                    2. Gameplay Elements
                       - Turn structure mechanics
                       - Risk assessment challenges
                       - Time pressure elements
                       - Team coordination requirements
                       - Emergency response scenarios
                    
                    3. Learning Objectives
                       - Safety protocol knowledge
                       - Procedure compliance
                       - Risk awareness
                       - Team communication
                       - Decision-making under pressure
                    
                    4. Assessment Metrics
                       - Safety compliance scoring
                       - Team coordination rating
                       - Response time tracking
                       - Protocol adherence measurement
                       - Communication effectiveness
                    
                    Based on these role-specific documents:
                    {% for x in snippets %}
                    {{x.text}}
                    {% endfor %}
                    
                    Please design:
                    1. Specific game components for this role
                    2. Role-specific scenarios and challenges
                    3. Assessment criteria and scoring mechanisms
                    4. Integration points with other roles
                    5. Safety learning objectives and outcomes
